# **Personalized Learning Portal (Proof of Concept)**

### ðŸš€ **Overview**

The Personalized Learning Portal is a Proof of Concept (PoC) that provides an intelligent system for creating custom learning paths based on user requirements, AI-generated content, and dynamic assessments. It integrates with Azure OpenAI GPT-4 to generate overviews, quizzes, and learning recommendations tailored to the user's input and goals.

---

## **Project Features**

### ðŸ’¡ Main Features:

1. **Dynamic Overview Generation**:
   - Explains what the topic is and why it is useful.
2. **Custom Knowledge Assessment**:
   - Creates dynamic beginner-level quizzes using Azure OpenAI GPT-4.
3. **Personalized Learning Path**:
   - Evaluates user's knowledge level and suggests a relevant learning path based on score.
4. **Modular Architecture**:
   - Decoupled backend (Node.js) and frontend (React.js) services.

### ðŸ›  **Technology Used**:

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - Azure OpenAI GPT-4 Integration
- **Frontend**:
  - React.js
  - Axios for API requests
- **Containerization**:
  - Docker
  - Docker Compose

## **Getting Started**

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

---

### **Prerequisites**

1. **Node.js** installed on your machine. ([Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/))
2. **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your machine. ([Install Docker & Compose](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
3. **Azure OpenAI Resource**:
   - Create an Azure OpenAI account and set up an instance of GPT-4.
   - Retrieve the **API key** and **endpoint URL** from your Azure portal.

---

### **Installation and Running Locally**

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this project using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/personalized-learning-poc.git
cd personalized-learning-poc
```

#### Step 2: Set Up Backend

1. Navigate to the `backend/` folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Add environment variables for Azure OpenAI service:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:
     ```bash
     AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-openai-instance.openai.azure.com
     AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
     ```
3. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Test the backend locally:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```
   The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

#### Step 3: Set Up Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend/` folder:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```
2. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the frontend locally:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The React frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

1. Navigate to the project root directory:
   ```bash
   cd personalized-learning-poc
   ```
2. Start the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
3. Access the application:
   - Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Backend: `http://localhost:5000`
